# BIGVU-assignment

The assignment is stored in the "BIGVU Assignment" folder. just need to download the folder and run the html file.

notes:
- Regarding the implementaion, You required 2 routes for the website. I chose to use vanilla js with no frameworks.
  Since it is relatively simple to implement using frameworks(like Angular) , and bit complicated to implement in vanilla, I opt to implement it with simple   buttons, so that i can focus on the main parts of the assignment.
